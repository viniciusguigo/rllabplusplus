# rllab++

rllab++ is a framework for developing and evaluating reinforcement learning algorithms, built on [rllab](https://github.com/openai/rllab). It has the following implementations besides the ones implemented in rllab:

- [Q-Prop](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02247)
- [IPG](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00387)
- [DQN](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vmnih/docs/dqn.pdf)
- [DDPG](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02971)
- [NAF](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00748)

The codes are experimental, and may require tuning or modifications to reach the best reported performances.

# Installation

Please follow the basic installation instructions in [rllab documentation](https://rllab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

# Examples

From the [launchers](/sandbox/rocky/tf/launchers) directory, run the following, with optional additional flags defined in [launcher_utils.py](/sandbox/rocky/tf/launchers/launcher_utils.py):

```
python algo_gym_stub.py --exp=<exp_name>
```

Flags include:

- algo\_name: trpo ([TRPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05477)), vpg (vanilla policy gradient), ddpg ([DDPG](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00748)), qprop ([Q-Prop](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02247) with trpo), etc. See [launcher_utils.py](/sandbox/rocky/tf/launchers/launcher_utils.py) for more variants.
- env\_name: [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/) environment name, e.g. HalfCheetah-v1.

The experiment will be saved in /data/local/\<exp\_name\>.
